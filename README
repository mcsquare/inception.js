**fQuery** *(project name)* is a small javascript framework. The main purpose is to make your javascript projects more structuralized.

* Minimal chance of javascript errors due to duplicate namespaces.
* Gives the developer a gateway where he/she can process and alter incoming functions (before they are created).
* Makes it easier to maintain and overview your project through a personalized framework.
* A barebone solution if you want to build your own framework and need a stable foundation.
* *jQuery* integration throughout the whole object.




**fQuery** is currently *jQuery* dependant, but this will change as soon as I get some extra free time...
